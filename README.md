Virtually nobody reads terms before going to agreeing with them. It's a lie and we need to fix it.
We are trying to make it better with [Zeema](http://mnmtanish.koding.io/). 

It's the Gravatar for Terms.

## Description

Here's what Zeema does:

* let's say we've an app called [catsbook](http://catsbook.meteor.com/)
* Developers of [catsbook](http://catsbook.meteor.com/) comes to zeema and selects terms they require.
* Lets assume you are "John"
* John also maintain's a list of terms he agrees with in zeems.com
* Once John logs into [catsbook](http://catsbook.meteor.com/), zeema will let you whether terms you accepted are aligned with of the website or not.
