* let's say we've an app called "catsbook.com" * developers of catsbook.com comes to zeema and selects terms they required 
* we've also an user called "jhon" 
* jhon also maintain a list of terms he agrees globally in zeema 
* then once jhon logs into catsbook.com, zeema will tell it's safe or not safe to use the web site based on the terms he agrees. {{/markdown}}

With zeema, you don't need to worry about asking users to agree with terms. You just specify terms you need, we'll take care of the rest. This is all you've to do: 

* visit zeema.com and select terms you need 
* we've a list of commonly used terms (try to pick from them) 
* if needed, you can add custom terms as well 
* Then you will get a javascript code to paste on the bottom of the app's HTML code {{/markdown}}

With zeema, you don't need to read lengthy pages of terms to agree them. You can simply select a set of terms you agree at first. Then whenever you visit one of the zeema powered web app, you'll get notified(inside the app) if there are terms you don't agree. 

Then you can take actions right away. This is all you've to: <u>**visit zeema.com and select terms you agree**</u> That's all. {{/markdown}}
