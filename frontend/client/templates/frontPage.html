* let's say we have a app called "catsbook.com"
* catsbook.com developers can add there terms in Zeema 
* Lets assume there is also an user called "John"
* John also maintain's a list of terms he agrees with in zeems.com
* When the John logs into catsbook.com, zeema will notify you whether there are terms that you have not agreed to.  If you feel the terms of catsbook is agreeable you can go to zeema and agree with those terms as well.{{/markdown}}

With zeema, you don't need to worry about asking users to agree with terms. You just specify terms you need, we'll take care of the rest. This is all you've to do: 

* visit zeema.com and select terms you need 
* we've a list of commonly used terms (try to pick from them) 
* if needed, you can add custom terms as well 
* Then you will get a javascript code to paste on the bottom of the app's HTML code {{/markdown}}

With zeema, you don't need to read lengthy pages of terms to agree them. You can simply select a set of terms you agree at first. Then whenever you visit one of the zeema powered web app, you'll get notified(inside the app) if there are terms you don't agree. 

Then you can take actions right away. This is all you've to: <u>**visit zeema.com and select terms you agree**</u> That's all. {{/markdown}}
